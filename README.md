Origins:
Hey there! This is a project that seeks to provide better user-video pose feedback to help learners of k-pop dance and other dances to more accurately learn dances and have more fun while learning. The idea for this project came from my beginner experience learning k-pop dances. My love for k-pop dancing came from my decision to join in a random dance event at a school event. When I first joined I knew nothing about k-pop except the word BTS, I didn't understand why people liked it because I never experienced it. After that experience of joining in, even though I couldn't dance very well, I began to like dancing very much and decided to learn more about k-pop dance so I could better understand and connect with this community of classmates at my school. When I started learning k-pop, it was harder than I expected. I heard someone on youtube say learning dancing is like learning a language because you will become better at it the more your learn. Once you learn some moves, other moves will be learnt more quicker and more naturally. Even though it is clear that more time spent will help you become better at it, I still felt that the learning experience could be improved. That's why I decided to make this project. 

Teamwork:
The initial foundation for this project is intended to be created with my fellow team members: xxx, xxx. And, it will be entered for CTB (China Think Big).
